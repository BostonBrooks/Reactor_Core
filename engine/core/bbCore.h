/** The core is responsible for maintaining the state shared between computers
 * in the multplayer game. The core needs to rewind and recalculate state in the
 * event that a network packet comes in late and needs to be dealt with.
 *
 * The core is based on a stack of instructions that are executed in a LIFO order.
 * Instructions are popped and then can puch new instructions to the top of the
 * stack.A second stack is maintained that stores the reverse of the instructions
 * executed, which is used to rewind the game state. In order to fast-forward
 * the game state back to where is was, input instructions are pushed onto the
 * first stack.
